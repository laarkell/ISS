      <h3>What should you look for?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>First off, it has to be night time for you to see the ISS in the sky. It is only visible when it refelcts the light of the sun, similar to the moon.</li>
        <li>Don't look for something stationary! It resembles a fast-moving plane or very bright star moving across the sky.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that it will not be flashing and it will not change direction.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Couldn't spot it tonight?</h3>
      <p>Keep searching! The ISS could pass over you several times a week or as little as once a month.</p>
