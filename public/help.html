      <h3>About This Project</h3>
      <p> Often, companies say their data is released and open to the public. But what does that mean? A bunch of incomprehensible numbers and spreadsheets. NASA does this exact thing. They're data is really only open to those with high enough knowledge in that specific field to understand it.
      My aim for this project was to make at least one data set accessible and understandable to the public. I landed on the location of the ISS and how to spot it in the sky. To the untrained eye, it’s just an airplane. But to me, it’s so much more.</p>
      <h3>About Lauren</h3>
      <p>I am a physics major and digital studies minor at Davidson College. With a passion for stargazing and hiking, I always want to be as close as I can to the stars. My goals are to tackle all of NH's 4,000 footers, become and astronaut, and have a farm.</p>
