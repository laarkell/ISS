      <h3>How many are there?</h3>
      <p>Stargazing should really be called satellite gazing, considering how many satellites there are in the sky above us.
        Here are some numbers: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>6,000 total satellites orbiting earth</li>
          <li>3,000 active satellites</li>
          <li>11 space stations orbiting earth</li>
          <li>29,000 space objects in orbit, for sizes larger than 10 cm</li>
          <li>170 million space objects in orbit, for sizes larger than 1 mm</li>
          </ul>
        <p>As the sky above earth gets crowded, it's about time to draw up some guidelines and rules to ensure space is safe for future activites and to control waste.</p>
