        <li>First, I'm sorry if this takes an extra second to load! This page will be slower because of how many satellites there are.</li>
        <li>On this map is every satellite that is above the horizon for somone in Davidson, NC.</li>
        <li>Many are not visible in the night sky, but don't be fooled, they are all above you. Many are even watching or listening to you.</li>
        <li>The map refreshes their movement every second.</li>
        <li>Check in every now and then to see how many there are above you at any second.</li>
