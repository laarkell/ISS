        <li>First off, it has to be night time for you to see the ISS in the sky. It is only visible when it refelcts the light of the sun, similar to the moon.</li>
        <li>It resembles a fast-moving plane or very bright star moving across the sky.</li>
        <li>It will not be flashing and it does not change direction.</li>
        <li>Keep searching! The ISS could pass over you several times a week or as little as once a month.</li>
