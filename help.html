      <h3>About this project</h3>
      <p> Often, companies say their data is released and open to the public. But what does that mean? A bunch of random coded numbers that mean nothing to an average eye. NASA is the same way, they brag about being open and available, but really, they’re only open to those with high enough knowledge in that specific field.
      My aim for this project was to make at least one data set accessible in an understandable way for the public. I landed on the location of the ISS and how to spot it in the sky. To the untrained eye, it’s just an airplane. But to me, it’s so much more.</p>
      <h3>About Lauren</h3>
      <p>I am a physics major and digital studies minor at Davidson College. With a passion for stargazing and hiking, I would rather be as close as I can to the stars than anywhere else. I have only complete 5 out of NH's 48 4000-footers, but my goal is to tackle them all, one by one.</p>
